# CONFIGURATION NOTES
# ===========================
# 
# This configuration file supports the complete BeyondTrust environment setup including:
# 1. Two Jump Groups (Site A and Site B)
# 2. One Team for user organization
# 3. Three Jump Policies:
#    - Standard Business (business hours access)
#    - High Security (strict controls, 2FA required)
#    - Manager Access (extended permissions)
# 4. One Jumpoint Cluster for connectivity
# 5. Two Group Policies:
#    - Manager Users Policy (full permissions, team manager role)
#    - Standard Users Policy (limited permissions, team member role)
#
# The script will automatically:
# - Create all objects with proper relationships
# - Assign appropriate Jump Item Roles and Jump Policies
# - Configure team memberships with correct roles
# - Set up Jumpoint access for both Group Policies
# - Save tracking information for cleanup
#
# Usage:
#   .\BeyondTrust-Complete-Configuration.ps1                 (Create all objects)
#   .\BeyondTrust-Complete-Configuration.ps1 -Cleanup       (Remove all objects)
#   .\BeyondTrust-Complete-Configuration.ps1 -ConfigFile "custom-config.txt"
#
# Security Features Implemented:
# - Manager Policy: Full session control, team management, all Jump access
# - Standard Policy: Basic session access, member role, controlled Jump access
# - High Security Policy: 2FA required, notifications enabled, no simultaneous sessions
# - Standard Business Policy: Business hours restriction, basic security
# - Manager Access Policy: Extended hours, 2FA required
#
# Object Relationships Created:
# - Manager Users Policy:
#   * Team membership as Manager
#   * Jump Group A access with Standard Business policy + Manage role
#   * Jump Group B access with Standard Business policy + Manage role
#   * Jumpoint Cluster access
#   * All session capabilities enabled
#
# - Standard Users Policy:
#   * Team membership as Member
#   * Jump Group A access with Standard Business policy + Start Sessions role
#   * Jump Group B access with High Security policy + Start Sessions role
#   * Jumpoint Cluster access
#   * Limited session capabilities
#
# Cleanup:
# The script creates a tracking file (bt-created-objects.json) that stores
# all created object IDs. Use the -Cleanup parameter to remove everything
# created by this script in reverse order to avoid dependency issues.
#
# Customization:
# You can modify any of the settings above to match your environment.
